# Bioniscope

Open-source Bluetooth oscilloscope with an Android UI.
More information coming soon.

The project was undertaken for my A-Level Electronics coursework, so things like the writeup had to meet a certain specification and are hence pretty funky.

 * **app** --- the Android app
 * **circuit** --- Diptrace (with images & gebers) files for the circuit & PCB
 * **datasheets** --- PDF datasheets of the ICs used
 * **enclosure** --- OpenSCAD laser-cut enclosure
 * **experiments** --- brief experiments done to e.g., determine existing scope accuracies
 * **research** --- various bits of saved research into things like scope triggering
 * **simulations** --- LTSpice simulations of various parts of the circuit
 * **writeup** --- the project report needed for the A-Level
