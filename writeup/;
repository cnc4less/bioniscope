\section{Test Procedure}
\subsection{Overall System}

Three different tests will be done to test the overall system. To run these
tests a square wave and a sinusoid wave will be produced using a signal
generator at \SI{100}{\Hz}, \SI{1}{\kHz}, \SI{10}{\kHz} and \SI{20}{\kHz}. Using
the stated accuracy of the signal generator, the frequency of the waves will be
accurate to within ... and the amplitude to within ... .

\fxwarning{Signal generator accuracy}

The sinusoid wave will be fed into the oscilloscope at each different frequency,
and the time period and amplitude recorded from the waveform view. These will be
compared to the known values to compute an accuracy value for the oscilloscope.






\chapter{Testing}
\section{Test Procedure}
At a range of different input frequencies (what did we use?)
Input a square wave and sinusoid wave to the system
At a known time period and amplitude
Look at time period and amplitude of scope waveform
Calculate accuracy. Signal generate accurate to ... so use that accuracy.

Equipment

At a range of different input frequencies (what did we use?)
Input a square wave and sinusoid wave to the system
At a known time period
Look at frequencies on FFT
Verify right pattern and record Fs step
Calculate accuracy. Signal generate accurate to ... so use that accuracy.

At a range of different input frequencies (what did we use?)
Input a square wave to the system
At a known time period
Look at digital waveform time period
Calculate accuracy. Signal generate accurate to ... so use that accuracy.

On all three, qualitatively check they look the same

Check it works with a 20khZ wave. Assume accurate to
>50\% (why is that a reasonable estimate?) and then check with a 30kHz wave.

Check the bandwidth of the scope. Assume accurate to >50\%  and then check
bandwidth greater than 1.5 * whatever we said.

Resolution given by ADC, so don't need to check.
Memory depth done programatically, so don't need to check.

Check at +- 50mV. Use an oscilloscope to check accuracy of wave we're putting in
(previously found scope to be accurate to less than 1\%)
Check at +- 5V

\section{Initial Assessment of System}
Works accurately, but doesn't work with negative voltages. Means it only has
limited usefulness. Still good for digital though.

\section{Limitations}
Issue is negative voltages don't go through the digital pot.
To overcome this, we have some pre analogue circuitry that offests everything
and scales by a gain of 0.5.

Built the circuitry, and tested it. It works.

\section{Reassessment of System}
Now very useful. All works.
